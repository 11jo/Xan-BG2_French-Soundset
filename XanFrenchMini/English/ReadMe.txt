			    Xan Audio v.2
			by Kulyok & Eleima




I. About the mod

This mod changes Xan's soundset into the French one. Those audio files are the
original files excerpted from BG1. You will be able to choose between keeping
or not the English audio files used in dialogs (PC dialogs, banters,
interjections, etc).


II. Installation

Installs the same as any other WeiDU mod. Of course, Kulyok's Xan for BG2 must
be installed!  The sounds installed are Xan's BG1 soundset (tailored to match
the more extensive BG2 soundset), as well as audio files for Bioware NPCs and
minor characters in Xan's side quests.


III. Other informations

WARNING: This mod is intended for French speakers. The soundset is changed to
FRENCH. Uninstallation of this mod does not guarantee recovery of the original
English files. Your only option would then be to reinstall Kulyok's Xan for BG2.
